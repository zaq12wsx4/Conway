### Description

This is a python implementation of [Conway's Game of Life](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life) that I created in 2018 for my "Into to Computer Science" class. It is a very simple implementation using the [Turtle graphics](https://docs.python.org/3/library/turtle.html) library.

### About

I had thoroughly enjoyed programming since high school, but when I got to college, the combination of boring general education classes, terrible teachers, and awful computer science classes made me question whether I wanted to go into computer science at all. My intro class, however, saved my love for programming. While the teacher received many complaints about going through curriculum too fast, and expecting too much of us, I adored it. For the first time I found myself sitting on my bed at home, laptop in hand, enjoying my homework. I am incredibly thankful that I got to take this class, so I just wanted to share my favorite project from the class. While not the hardest project we worked on, I still think back to it to this to remember why I enjoy programming.
